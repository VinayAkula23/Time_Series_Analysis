# Time_Series_Analysis
# Project Title: Analysis and prediction of "Microsoft _stock.csv" file which contains stocks and credits of IT form. prediction the value of stock in future by three category "Open"High","Low".
# Problem Statement:
This dataset provides a detailed analysis of Microsoft's stock performance from 1986 to 2023, including stock price, low and high prices, and trading volume. It showcases the company's journey in the stock market, revealing trends and fluctuations over time. The data covers key milestones and offers insights into market valuation. It also includes trading volume data to gauge investor activity. Researchers, investors, and analysts can use this dataset to study long-term trends, historical patterns, and technology industry dynamics. However, it's crucial to supplement this information with other financial data for informed decision-making. The dataset is current until 2023, offering up-to-date insights into Microsoft's stock performance.

# Abstract:
Time Series Analysis A Time Series is a set of observations that are collected after regular intervals of time. If plotted, the Time series would always have one of its axes as time. Time Series Analysis in Python considers data collected over time might have some structure; hence it analyses Time Series data to extract its valuable characteristics.

# project Approached Steps:
Loading and Exploring Data.
Visualizing Time Series
Decomposing Time Series into Components
Decomposition in Time series analysis.
Project Methodology
# Trend:
The Trend shows the variation of data with time or the frequency of data. Using a Trend, you can see how your data increases or decreases over time. The data can increase, decrease, or remain stable. Over time, population, stock market fluctuations, and production in a company are all examples of trends.
# Seasonality:
Seasonality is used to find the variations which occur at regular intervals of time. Examples are festivals, conventions, seasons, etc. These variations usually happen around the same time period and affect the data in specific ways which you can predict.
# Irregularity:
Fluctuations in the time series data do not correspond to the trend or seasonality. These variations in your time series are purely random and usually caused by unforeseeable circumstances, such as a sudden decrease in population because of a natural calamity.
# Cyclic:
Oscillations in time series which last for more than a year are called cyclic. They may or may not be periodic.
# Stationary:
A time series that has the same statistical properties over time is stationary. The properties remain the same anywhere in the series. Your data needs to be stationary to perform time-series analysis on it. A stationary series has a constant mean, variance, and covariance.

# Conclusion:
According to the time series analysis of data for this particular dataset we found that "open,high,low,close"are the columns in which trades in increasing manner but in the year 2020-2021 the stocks are goes in decreasing manner

According to the volume chart for particular this data set 2016-2017 gives the littlebit of more profit to investments in the stocks.
After 2017 to upcoming year stocks will be pluctuated
